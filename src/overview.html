NIES is a web frontend for information retrieval from a GHIRL-based data
repository. NIES currently supports a Saccharomyces-centric publication
dataset, but there are immediate plans to extend it to support
additional datasets focused on the Drosophila and Machine Learning domains.

<p>NIES is a Struts app. You can find more information about Struts
online, but the basic data flow for a Struts app goes somewhat like
this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>User requests a URL</li>
	<li>struts.xml maps the URL to an Action, which is associated with
	a class and a method for handling the request, a set of validation
	criteria, a stack of Interceptors, and one or more JSPs for displaying
	results according to the return signal from the action.</li>
	<li>Request variables (the ?arg=value&arg=value portion of the URL
	for a GET, or the encoded values for a POST) are validated; validations
	failures bounce you back to the calling page</li>
	<li>Interceptors are executed, one of which fills Bean-style
	variables in an instance of the Action's class with values from the
	request</li>
	<li>Action is executed using the method specified in struts.xml,
	filling other bean variables and returning a control signal (success,
	input, error, etc)</li>
	<li>Results are displayed in a JSP as specified in struts.xml.
	This page has access to the bean variables in the Action.</li>
</ol>

<p>This should hopefully make the package layout a little more clear.</p>

<p>The package breakdown is as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>These all have direct mappings to the Struts framework:
	<ul>
		<li>{@link nies.actions} -- Struts action classes as named in 
		src/struts.xml</li>
		<li>{@link nies.interceptors} -- Struts interceptors for checking
		authentication status</li>
		<li>{@link nies.validation} -- Struts forms validation (these are
		declared in src/validators.xml and keyed to some of the actions using
		.xml files in {@link nies.actions})</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>These are auxilliary packages:
	<ul>
		<li>{@link nies.data} -- database model/view/controller as
		specified by sleepycat JE -- the user DB and the relevance DB is in
		here</li>
		<li>{@link nies.metadata} -- Tomcat servlet for autocomplete and
		GHIRL graph access; also provides access to metadata displayed in
		search results page</li>
		<li>{@link nies.ui} -- model for the display of search results. A
		Tab knows how to change a GHIRL Distribution of search results into a
		list of Result objects containing all the metadata needed for display
		on the results page.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>The display code (JSPs) are all in web/; they make abundant
	use of struts tags as well as some
	use of a javascript engine called dijit.
