UI Test Cases for NIES
December 2009, Katie Rivard - krivard@andrew.cmu.edu

These .html files encode test cases which can be run using a test engine called 
Selenium.

Download the Selenium IDE add-on for Firefox to load and run suites of tests or 
individual tests.

If you find a bug, use the IDE to write a new test that fails when the bug is
active and succeeds when the bug has been fixed.  This will help us maintain 
accurate functionality.

While the Firefox add-on is the most convenient way to write and run these 
tests, it is not the only way.  Selenium tests can be run in any 
javascript-compatible browser given the appropriate accompanying materials. If 
you need a non-firefox option, contact Katie and we can collect those materials 
here as well.
