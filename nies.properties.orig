# Uncomment to show all results in a special tab (default is off)

#nies.extraSearchFields=genes

### TAB CONFIGURATION:

# First list the tab titles as you want them to appear in the interface.
# These should be unique and subject to the following restrictions:
#   - "Other" is a reserved title for the allTab so don't use it.
#   - Do not include spaces.
#   - '_' is ok; use other special characters at your own risk 
nies.tabs=Papers,Papers_tx,Genes,Authors,Terms

# Next list the tab type for each tab (same order as nies.tabs)
# NB These are the keys into the .class map in Tab
nies.tabtypes=paper,configurable,configurable,configurable,configurable

# For each "configurable"-type tab, specify:
# 	nies.[title].filter - the filter string that selects nodes displayable by this tab
#	nies.[title].attributes - the list of attributes as displayed in the block for each search result
#	nies.[title].[attribute] - for each attribute, the PathSearcher list of edges to traverse to select nodes for display
# Attributes *may* include spaces in the .attributes list, but replace these with _ when you give their PathSearcher list.
